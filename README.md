experimenting with python

## steps to follow for practising python like a kata

#### step 1 -- download git 
 
 this is the version control tool... 
 its a must have for any developer; 
 and for the beginers this will give a good mechanism to connect with already written good codebases that you can use as a starting point
 here is the download page for Windows operating system = https://git-scm.com/download/win
 for other operating system options.. use https://git-scm.com/download

#### step 2 -- install git
 
 follow all default options and install git on your local machine
 once you finish installing, it is a good idea to reboot your machine and try out this tool
 from windows run command type "gitbash" and let it open the terminal window
 you can type "git --version" and see the output

#### step 3 -- download pyCharm community edition
 
 this is an opensource tool (IDE) and a good one for Python.. its from IntelliJ Idea
 [page link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) -- navigate down to see [Community edition
 exe link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC)
 install this tool with all its default options
 after install run pyCharm and create a new Project
 use the default main.py that it creates or add your new script files
 try out different python commands, functions and modules

#### step 4 -- organize your folders
 
 it is a good idea to organize your folder structure-- it gives a good discipline as well will help for future references when you want to try out the same experiments after a period of time
 one example is C:/workspaces/<sample 01>


#### step 5 -- connect to a code repository
 
 make use of the good code repositories from gitlab or similar areas
 here are few links
 * a repo from myself: `git clone https://github.com/amitrajpurkar/playwithpy.git`
 * a book reference for above exercises -- [link here](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/A_Practical_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_Heinold.pdf)
 * [one more repo for same book](https://github.com/henrytirla/Practical-Introduction-to-python)
 * good ref from Oleksii Trekhleb @uber: [learn python repo](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python)
 * https://github.com/virgili0/Virgilio
 * for book: Tiny Python Projects: [code repo](https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects/)


#### step 6 -- open & play with checked out code in pyCharm
 
 * just like we say <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">read, read, read...</span>
 * there is another saying as well <span style="background-color: #7FFFD4">practise, practise, practise</span>


#### step 7 -- important python references
 
 make use of this valuable documentation from Python itself
 * documention home page = https://docs.python.org/3/
 * library reference = https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
 * language reference = https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
 * developer guide = https://devguide.python.org/
